# Web Servers

* What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
It is run from the command line and does not have a user friendly interface.  

* In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

In my understanding, it is either a computer or blocked off portion of a computer that acts as it's own computer. Benefits are speed for accessing data and security for files included.  Also, security for any personal computer. 

* Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

My understanding is that this is bad for security and knowing who has been editing the software.  Root is the core user, that does not have a particular identity. Meaning that anyone could log into that and mess with things and you would not know who did it.
