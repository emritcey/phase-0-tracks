# Notes on jQuery 
How I plan to approach this:
First, I will make a list of basic questions to outline my research so that I can easily go back to my answers at a later date. I will look for cheat sheets, stack examples, and see if there is any sort of jQuery Docs. Then, once I have figured out the basics, I will run a basic example on my computer to test it out. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is jQuery?
A JavaScript Library for manipulating HTML documents. Includes features for DOM manipulation, Event handling, Animations, etc. Most helpful for dealing with cross-browser inconsistencies. It can help when a design won't load on a certain browser, because it loads in many different browsers with ease. It is also programmer-friendly, making things a lot easier and code look neater.

2. How does one access jQuery? Terminal? Sublime? 
Need to install locally, and put a copy of the download into the website/program directory. 

3. Is there anything to install into system (like SQLite)?
No, it is a file. 

4. Find a cheat sheet or 2.

5. What are 10 important commands. 


6. What languages can you pair into it? 
All! But it is for java and html mostly. 

7. Other important information: 
- It is constantly being updated, so it is up to date with newer versions of other programming languages like CSS3. 
- It has a user interface option (jQuery User Interface or jQuery UI) which can be used to create premade widgets and effects. 
- It also has the option of adding plugins, as to not overclog with unnecessary language.
