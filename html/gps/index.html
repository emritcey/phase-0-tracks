<!-- Answered questions as a team. 

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

	Semantic tags help keep an HTML document organized in a standardized way so that it can be easily manipulated and edited later on. Picking a most useful tag is subjective, as we think that this will be based on content of the website being worked on.  nav seems like the most important usually though, because there will always be links to other content, and it is important to be able to edit these seperataly. 


What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

	The browser uses top down without CSS or other external formatting. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

	Neither of us knew how snippets worked, and now see how Sublime can be used to save a lot of time while coding. We both were using the HTML[tab] function without really understanding where this was sourced from. I think we will both use snippets later! 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept? 

	Snippets! They were foreign for us both, so we spent the most time reading and talking about how they work.  I think after working together, we understand them more and will continue to use them in the future.
